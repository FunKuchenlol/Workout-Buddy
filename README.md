# Workout-Buddy

An Application to help you keeping an overview of your training and to help you to pull through your plans.
Created because of an Schoolproject.

## TODO (new):

- [ ] better UX (already working on it âœ¨)
- [ ] .gitignore should not ignore saved_pictures but the contents of it
- [ ] Use same cardlayout for edit and delete. Edit can have same editing site as add_device, but user needs to see the saved values while editing (Need to think how I want to present that)
- [ ] Database changes (unfortunately ðŸ˜­) and all changes that come with that...:
- [ ] Devices, that save active time (in min), no break time and no sets (aka. stamina devices)
- [ ] Devices, that save repetitions, breaktime (in s) and sets (aka. strength devices)
- [ ] Add device needs an choosing screen then, where the user can choose between adding a stamina, or strength device

## TODO (in general):

- [ ] Create Trainingplan
- [ ] Read Trainingplan
- [ ] Update Trainingplan
- [ ] Delete Trainingplan
