# Workout-Buddy

An Application to help you keeping an overview of your training and to help you to pull through your plans.
Created because of an Schoolproject.

## TODO (new):

- [ ] .gitignore should not ignore saved_pictures but not the contents in it
- [ ] Devices, that save active time (in min), no break time and no sets (aka. stamina devices)
- [ ] Add device needs an choosing screen then, where the user can choose between adding a stamina, or strength device

## TODO (in general):

- [ ] Create Trainingplan
- [ ] Read Trainingplan
- [ ] Update Trainingplan
- [ ] Delete Trainingplan
- [ ] Building a Training Timer (more about the functions of that: notes about it on my phone)
- [ ] Add weekdays and calendar stuff to trainingsplan

## DONE:

- [x] Devices, that save repetitions, breaktime (in s) and sets (aka. strength devices)
- [x] Use same cardlayout for edit and delete. Edit can have same editing site as add_device, but user needs to see the saved values while editing (Need to think how I want to present that)
- [x] better UX (already working on it âœ¨)
- [x] Edit Device
- [x] Delete Device
- [x] Create Device
- [x] All Devices
- [x] About
- [x] Nav-bar
- [x] Create, Read, Update, Delete Device helper (CRUD)
